# <span style="color: green;">3. The O&M Challenge: Staffing Constraints and Efficiency Bottlenecks</span>

Common pain points in traditional network management:

| Channel Partners                                                                         | End Customers                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One person can only manage a limited number of devices — scaling up means falling behind | Routine inspection of dozens of devices requires hours of clicking through Web UIs        |
| Experienced network engineers are scarce and costly                                      | Troubleshooting an offline device means jumping through multiple pages — slow and tedious |
| Customers are geographically dispersed, making on-site visits expensive                  | Signal quality requires manual lookup and comparison against standards                    |
|                                                                                          | Batch operations are done entirely by hand, device by device                              |

# <span style="color: green;">4. 9 AI Capabilities Covering the Full Device Lifecycle</span>
